## Technical Details
The runtime is used to run all RPG Maker 2003 games and runs all necessary systems, such as script interpretation.

It was written using a form of [Object Pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_Pascal), presumably [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(software)), but the source code has been lost over time ([see here](https://rpgmaker.net/engines/rm2k3/bulletins/30/)).

## Technical Controls
`F4` and `Alt+Enter` switch between fullscreen and windowed mode.

`F5` toggles the resolution between 640x480 and 320x240.

`F12` resets the runtime and returns it to the main menu.
