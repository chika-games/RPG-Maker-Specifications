# Unofficial RPG Maker 2000/2003 Specifications
## Introduction
This repository aims to completely document the RPG Maker 2000 (RM2k) and RPG Maker 2003 (RM2k3) game engines,
which were game engines developed by Enterbrain and published by ASCII Corporation, both of which are owned by Kadokawa Corporation.
As their names imply, these engines were released in 2000 and 2003, respectively,
and have largely superseded by newer versions of RPG Maker.

Despite this, they have a simplicity not present in newer versions of RPG Maker,
and their library of games is plentiful, including popular games such as Yume Nikki, Ib, and Grimm's Hollow.

## About the Specifications
The specifications within this project aim to be accurate and comprehensive. Each covers a specific aspect of RM2k and RM2k3.
These specifications are written in a technical style and are intended for developers, modders, and plugin makers.
