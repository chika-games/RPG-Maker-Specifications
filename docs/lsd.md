# LCF Save Data File Specification
## Introduction
LCF Save Data (LSD) files are used to store save data for RPG Maker 2000/2003 (RM2k/3) games.
LSD files use a tag-based format similar to the one used in e.g. Adobe SWF files. This allows for easy reading and writing.

RM2k/3 games typically store LSD files within the same directory as the game's executable file (`RPG_RT.exe`).
