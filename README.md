## About The Specifications
All of the specifications within this repository are written with independence in mind; all relevant information is included, and they make no reference to each other.

Each specification includes a table that specifies its __Version__, __Status__, and __License__ information.

__Version__ indicates the relevant document's version and follows a major.minor.revision format. The document may include a _Document Changes_ section that lists any notable changes between versions.

__Status__ indicates the status of a document's information. There are three main values this field can take: _Researching_, _Finalization_, and _Complete_.

_Researching_ means a specification is in the drafting phase and is presenting information that was being researched at the time of writing. As such, documents marked as _Researching_ shouldn't be relied upon for accurate information.

_Finalization_ is used when a format has been completely researched, and its specification is being written to detail the research. Though incomplete, information within _Finalization_ documents should be taken as trustworthy unless otherwise noted (see _Speculation_).

_Complete_ means a specification completely describes its respective file format in detail. These documents may be relied upon for accurate information unless otherwise noted (see _Speculation_).

In addition to the three statuses above, documents may also be marked as _Speculation_. This means some information contained is only an educated guess and has not been totally confirmed. Any speculated information will be superscripted with a question mark (?). Take this information with a grain of salt.

__License__ provides a document's copyright license.
